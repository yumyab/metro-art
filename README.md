A typescript script to generate a random painting from the The Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection API (https://metmuseum.github.io/).

Sort of a "Daily Dose of Culture" idea.

The API is completely open to the public!

>To the extent possible under law, The Metropolitan Museum of Art has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to this dataset using the Creative Commons Zero license. 

The main functions of the program:

Generate a random image from the [Metropolitan Museum of Art Collection](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/the-collection), in this case the European Classical Collection, which is [department #11.](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search?showOnly=withImage&department=11) 

Credit and link back to the Metropolitan Museum of Art URL.

Display title, artist, date, medium, dimensions and credit line of the painting

Add a button to generate a new image etc.

If the painting errors and doesnt generate (usually a licencing issue of the original painting, and it's agreements on reproductions etc) delete info and regenerate.
